This document should help you explain how your user interfaces are designed. You should have a wireframe to give a good overview and some screenshot with simple writeups to justify your designs.

## Wireframe

> This is just an example, please find your own wireframe.

## Justifications

### Justification 1

#### Good Points

1. Advanced filter for accurate search of data. The data viewer has a dropdown box to search for each individual column as well as  a dropdown for operators as a search function.
2. Showing total number of rows can be useful for some instances.
3. Pagination tool shows page number as well as next or previous page functionality.
4. Amount of rows shown per page can be manipulated which can be useful to show more data.
5. Sorting by columns can be useful for looking at data such as: ascending or descending order of numbers; Alphabetical order; Date created.
6. Simple UI allowing admin to easily identify functionality of each button and also allows data to be viewed clearly.

#### Bad Points

1. Data with many column may be bad as the data shown may be too compact which lowers clarity of the data viewer.
2. No button for incrementing or reducing the number of rows shown can be ineffective in some instances.
3. Pagination tool does not have a back to first page function.

### Justification 2
